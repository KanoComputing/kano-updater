    u"In 1978, the fastest computer in the world was the "
    u"Cray 1 \N{EM DASH} it cost $7 million and weighed as "
    u"much as an average elephant! Your Kano is about 4 "
    u"times faster than the Cray 1. To keep it up to speed, "
    u"we're downloading new games, apps and projects, and "
    u"streamlining the computer's memory. This should take "
    u"about 15 minutes. In the meantime, why not take a "
    u"phone picture of your Kano? Send it to us at "
    u"<b>hello@kano.me</b> and we'll share it with the "
    u"world. You can also search for the white rabbit on "
    u"<b>http://world.kano.me</b>",

    u"Computers can learn new ideas quickly. Right now, "
    u"we're updating the Updater tool. Once this step is "
    u"finished, the Updater will relaunch. How do computers "
    u"think? They are made of electrical switches, "
    u"connected together in clever ways. If a switch is on, "
    u"that means \"yes\" or \"1\"; if it's off, that means "
    u"\"no\" or \"0\". These little yes-no switches become "
    u"a binary code \N{EM DASH} for words, sounds, rules, "
    u"and more. Your computer has over 10 million tiny "
    u"switches, called transistors, in its brain. In your "
    u"brain, these switches are cells called neurons. "
    u"They're talking to each other right now.",

    u"Python is one of the world's most popular programming "
    u"languages. A programming language takes words that "
    u"humans can understand, and translates them into "
    u"instructions that the computer's switches can "
    u"understand. A good \"make a sandwich\" program would "
    u"go through all the steps necessary to get the "
    u"sandwich made, from \"grab bread\" to \"pick up "
    u"knife\" to \"put it on a plate.\" The computer "
    u"follows a program in Python the way a cook follows a "
    u"recipe in English. Python code can build volcanos in "
    u"Minecraft, grab \"Gangnam Style\" from YouTube, and "
    u"move millions of dollars in the New York Stock "
    u"Exchange.",

    u"Kano OS is an operating system, which means it "
    u"connects all the programs together. This OS is based "
    u"on Linux, whose code is open \N{EM DASH} that means "
    u"that it's free for anyone to download, change or even "
    u"sell. Its code is written by hobbyists and makers "
    u"worldwide, not just professionals. Kano uses Debian, "
    u"a fun and powerful \"distribution\" of Linux which "
    u"the International Space Station also uses to run its "
    u"robotic systems \N{EM DASH} to keep the astronauts "
    u"from losing their lunch!",

    u"We're almost done! With your Kano computer, you'll "
    u"make awesome games, code your own music, stream "
    u"videos around your house, tell stories, and much "
    u"more. Your computer is open, and its powers are at "
    u"your command. If you want to get new cool projects "
    u"from us each week, join the community at",

    u"Your Kano will now reboot!\n"

    u"See you in a while\N{HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS}"
